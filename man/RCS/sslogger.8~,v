.SH NAME
sslogger \- execute a command or interactive shell, and record the output
.SH SYNOPSIS
sslogger  
.br
sslogger [-h] [-c command] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
sslogger is session keystroke logging utility and allows  permitted users to execute commands, or open interactive shells. When used in interactive session mode, sslogger records keystrokes in a special file. A tty is required for interactive sessions

sslogger also provides the ability to run in command mode in which a command can be executed. This allows sslogger to be used within a script in non-interactive script. When running this mode, stdin is closed.

Commands and interactive sessions write an entry to syslog. The default keystroke log files are written to /var/log/slog/<hostname>-<user1>-<user2>.<date>.log. The  sreplay command is included to review session log files created via sslogger, creating an audit trail of all actions performed by users.

When used in combination with slog and sudo, privileged user escalation can be controlled and audited by creating standard sudo rules.

By default, sslogger will change to the users home directory before executing a shell or command. Use the -h flag to remain in the current working directory.

.br
Cmnd_Alias SL = /usr/bin/sslogger

# user1 and user2 can now get an interactive root shell for root and user3
.br
# while logging all keystrokes

.TP
Configuration file /etc/sslogger.conf:
.br
#
.br
#Log output of all commands, even non interactive (1 is true). Default 0
.br
log_all_cmds=0

#Minimum Comment length in chars
.br
#an entry of 0 will skip reason for asking for a shell

.TP
$ slog -u user2
.br
- Obtains an interactive shell as another user.
.TP
