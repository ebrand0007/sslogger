.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION
sslogger is session keystroke logging utility and allows  permitted users to execute commands, or open interactive shells as the superuser or another user as specified by sudo rules in the sudoers file. When used in interactive session mode, sslogger records keystrokes in a special file. A tty is required for interactive sessions

sslogger also provides the ability to run in command mode in which a command can be executed as another user. This allows sslogger to be used within a script in non-interactive script. When running this mode, stdin is closed.

Commands and interactive sessions write an entry to syslog. The default keystroke log files are written to /var/log/sl/<hostname>-<user1>-<user2>.<date>.log. The  sreplay command is included to review session log files created via sslogger, creating an audit trail of all actions performed by users.

Privileged user escalation is set by standard sudo rules in sudoers file.
