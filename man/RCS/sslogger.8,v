.SH NAME
sslogger \- execute a command or interactive shell, and record the output
.SH SYNOPSIS
sslogger  
.br
sslogger [-h] [-c command] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
sslogger is session keystroke logging utility and allows  permitted users to execute commands, or open interactive shells. When used in interactive session mode, sslogger records keystrokes in a special file. A tty is required for interactive sessions. 

Two modes of logging are available, local logging and remote logging. Remote logging is performed through a secure TLS session. See the
.B sslogger.conf
manpage for details. A remote slogd server must configured for remote logging. 

The local default keystroke log files are written to /var/log/slog/<hostname>-<user1>-<user2>.<date>.log. The  sreplay command is included to review session log files created via sslogger, creating an audit trail of all actions performed by users. The keep_local_logs config setting can be set to remove the local log after successful transfer to the remote slogd server.

sslogger also provides the ability to run in command mode in which a command can be executed. This allows sslogger to be used within a script in non-interactive script. When running this mode, stdin is closed.

When used in combination with slog and sudo, privileged user escalation can be controlled and audited by creating standard sudo rules.

By default, sslogger will change to the users home directory before executing a shell or command. Use the -h flag to remain in the current working directory.  

All commands and interactive sessions write an entry to the local syslog.

.SH OPTIONS
.B sslogger
accepts the following command line options:
.br
.TP
.B -c command and args
Execute "command and args" instead if interactive shell. Provides ability run sslogger within a script. non-interactive mode
.TP
.B -h
Stay in current working directory, do not cd to USER home dir
.TP
.B -f
Flush buffer on every newline
.TP
.B -q
Suppress printing of SS logger start/finish information
.TP
.B -d
Debug
.br
.TP
The sreplay command can be used to sreplay recorded sessions
.br
.TP
.B sreplay <filename>
Replays interactive session identified by filename

.SH RETURN VALUES
In interactive mode, always exits 0.

When run in a non-interactive mode, slog returns the value of the command being run.

.SH EXAMPLES
Note: the following examples assume suitable sudoers(5) entries.
.TP
$ sslogger
.br
- Obtains an interactive shell, and log all keystrokes
.TP
$ sslogger -c ls -l /root
.br
- Runs command, logs output if log_all_cmds=1 in sslogger.conf
.TP
$ slog -u user2
.br
- Obtains an interactive shell as another user.
.TP
$ slog -u user2 -h
.br
- Obtains an interactive shell as user2 whilst remaining in the current working directory.
.TP
$ sreplay <filename>
.br
- Replays an interactive session log (may require user to be added to sloggers group, see (CONFIGURATION FILES)
